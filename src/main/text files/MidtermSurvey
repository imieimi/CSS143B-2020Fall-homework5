Mid-Term Survey

- What are you struggling the most in this class? Name some topics that you had the most difficulties in understanding.
    - I had a really hard time understanding how to implement linked lists and stacks. I understood the concepts but
    I just couldn't figure out how to set them up or how to use them in code. For example with stacks I had a hard
    time figuring out what I could do with stacks, or how to implement them since I didn't know the format of how they
    worked. Also I think it's just really hard to get everything done since the lab that we take as co-requisite for this
    course gives us labs that are also just as difficult.

What's been the best way for you to learn? Reading books? Lecture discussion? Homework? Coding practice?
    - Looking up examples online. Lectures have been helpful to understand concepts, but like I mentioned in the last
    question, I just struggle with figuring out how to make the concepts work in code.

What do you think would help improve your study that's missing from the class?
    - Examples? Or like short, easy practice questions during class that cover similar problems as the homeworks,
    and then a way to check if the practice question is right, to help make sure that we understand the topic before going
    to do more practice with homework.

In what aspects that you are going out of way to improve your learning and coding skill for this class?
    - Lots of online searching for tutorials.

Ask one question that you have been unable/afraid to ask in this class.
    - I don't think I have any.
